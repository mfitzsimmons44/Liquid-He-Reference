Data and GenX analysis for "Liquid Helium as a reference may provide clarity for some neutron reflectometry experiments"

The repository consists of data discussed in the paper with the title above.  Models were fitted to the data using GenX [A. Glavic and M. Bj√∂rck, J. Appl. Cryst. 55, 1063 (2022). https://aglavic.github.io/genx/ ]. The repository contains the GenX modules developed during the analysis.

The repository is organized according to "hard matter" and "soft matter" samples.  The "hard matter" samples are further subdivided into ones with sapphire or silicon substrates. The data files are named according to the correct layer scheme, e.g., Pt_Ta_Al2O3 means the Pt layer is on the Ta layer and the Ta layer is on the sapphire substrate and appended with the ".out" suffix. The data are 4 column format, Q (reciprocal Angstroms), R (reflectivity), sigma (R) and sigma (Q).

GenX modules are appended with the suffix ".hgx".  "Reversed" in the file name indicates a module that fitted the incorrect, reversed layer order, to the data.
